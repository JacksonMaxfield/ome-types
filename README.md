# pyOMElite

autogenerated dataclasses for a pythonic interface into the OME data model:
http://www.openmicroscopy.org/Schemas/OME/2016-06

It converts the ome.xsd schema into a set of python dataclasses and types.

`omelite.autogen.convert_schema(url, target)` is the main function.  It accepts an `xsd` file path (only test on an ome.xsd), and a target directory, and writes a human-readable module, that will validate OME XML, provide pythonic method naming, and provides full typing support for IDEs, etc...

The model is not checked into source, to build it, checkout this package and run:

```bash
python -m omelite.autogen
```

it will write the model to `omelite/model`.  It can then be imported and used as usual:

```python
from omelite import OME  # the root class

# or specific objects
from omelite.model import Image, Pixels, Plate  # etc...
```

There is a convenience function that accepts xml, and outputs a *validated* OME model
(if it fails validation, an exception is raised):

```python
from omelite import from_xml

metadata = from_xml(xml)
```

where `xml` in that example can be a path to a file, a URI of a
resource, an opened file-like object, an Element instance, an ElementTree
instance, or a literal string containing the XML data.
