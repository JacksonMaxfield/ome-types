    This is just notice that the contents of Pixels will be moved up to Image in a future
    release. This is because there has only been 1 Pixels object in each Image for some
    time. The concept of multiple Pixels sets for one Image failed to take off. It is
    therefore redundant.

    The Image will be unreadable if any of the required Pixel attributes are missing.

    The Pixels themselves can be stored within the OME-XML compressed by plane, and encoded
    in Base64. Or the Pixels may be stored in TIFF format.

    The Pixels element should contain a list of BinData or TiffData, each containing a
    single plane of pixels. These Pixels elements, when read in document order, must produce
    a 5-D pixel array of the size specified in this element, and in the dimension order
    specified by 'DimensionOrder'.

    All of the values in the Pixels object when present should match the same value stored
    in any associated TIFF format (e.g. SizeX should be the same). Where there is a mismatch
    our readers will take the value from the TIFF structure as overriding the value in the
    OME-XML. This is simply a pragmatic decision as it increases the likelihood of reading
    data from a slightly incorrect file.
